                <h5>Mount Desert Island, ME, USA</h5>
                <p>I've been lucky enough to call Mt. Desert Island home for many summers. Acadia is a fantastic National Park with many great hikes, unspoiled ponds, unique habitats, and in turn, incredible birds. I recall encountering young, scruffy-looking Barred Owl chicks at Sieur de Mont Spring, Blackburnian Warblers and Northern Parulas singing overhead in the treetops all over the island, and of course the famous Bar Harbor boat tour to see Atlantic Puffins, Razorbills, and many other seafaring birds.</p>

                <h5>Los Angeles, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>This city park has become a bit of a running joke amongst me and my local birder friends. It has continuously served as year-round home to a lone male Canvasback - a type of duck. Oft times when were working towards a daily species count goal and have not seen a Canvasback, we end the day at Alondra late at night, shining flashlights into the water to confirm the presence of this unique duck.</p>

                <h4 id="amager">Amagerfælled</h4>
                <h5>Copenhagen, Denmark</h5>
                <p>While visiting my brother studying abroad in Copenhagen in 2015, I wandered to a nearby natural area in the outskirts called Amagerfælled. It is a partial wetland, relatively managed with many walking paths throughout. Highlights included a flyover Peregrine Falcon and a pair of Ring-necked Pheasant.</p>

                <h4 id="angeles">Angeles National Forest / Angeles Crest Highway</h4>
                <h5>Los Angeles County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>Winding through the mountains above Los Angeles, the Angeles Crest Highway carves through the San Gabriels, locally protected as the Angeles National Forest. I've spent many summer nights up here camping, as well as just going for an evening drive to see what owls might respond to recordings. Alpine species like White-headed Woodpecker, Pygmy Nuthatch and Mountain Chickadee are commonplace year-round. Come winter most of the road is closed for snow, but with the snow comes a chance of invading finches from the north looking for pinecone crops - Red Crossbills and Evening Grosbeaks. In summertime, migratory species like Green-tailed Towhee and Fox Sparrow breed in the mountains, and are worth at least a few visits.</p>

                <h4 id="av">Antelope Valley</h4>
                <h5>Los Angeles County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>The flat, desert region in the north of L.A. County known as Antelope Valley is a combination of farmland, barren fields, and scrub. Ferruginous Hawks dot the skyline in winter, desert specialties like LeConte's Thrasher skitter between bushes. The man-made oases of Piute Ponds and Apollo Park stand out as excellent stopover sites for migrants. The "A.V." as we call it, is also the the only place in the county to consistently find Mountain Plovers, in the culled fields during winter months.</p>

                <h4 id="ballona">Ballona Creek</h4>
                <h5>Playa del Rey, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>Where runoff meets ocean, this is a great coastal spot for lots of water-bound species. Rocky shorebirds like Black Oystercatchers, Surfbirds, and Black and Ruddy Turnstones dot the jetties; in the winter Surf Scoters and multiple grebe species are frequent visitors. The "creek" is referred to loosely in this context meaning the end of it in Playa del Rey - but the creek itself runs about 5 miles northeast into Los Angeles, it's a natural drainage path. These days, for flooding risk and water management, most of the creek is lined with concrete. But it is in fact a naturally occurring waterway.</p>

                <h5>Eastern Shore, MD, USA</h5>
                <p>I've only driven through this NWR once in the dusk of a February evening, 2011. But the sightings were unforgettable. Soaring through the dying light like ghosts, hunting singly and cresting across car headlights as we wound through the swamps, were at least 5 Short-eared Owls. A magical viewing experience.</p>

                <h4 id="bolsachica">Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve</h4>
                <h5>Orange County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>A well known treasure of Southern California birding, Bolsa Chica holds some of the best preserved habitat along the coast. No doubt that the crowds of birds rely on it due to it's stance as a last refuge of undeveloped coastal wetlands. Shorebirds like Red Knots and Long-billed Curlews, wading birds like Reddish Egrets, and many tern species all pass through here, while gracing few other coastal spots in the area.</p>

                <h5>Brownsville, TX, USA</h5>
                <p>An unexpected hotspot, the Brownsville dump on the southern tip of Texas has become a birding Mecca for travelers to try and glimpse the Tamaulipas Crow - a Mexican species - on U.S. soil. I have been twice over the years, and struck out both times. But I will no doubt one day return to eventually see a crow sitting on a pile of trash.</p>

                <p>The largest urban green space available, birds flock to Central Park both year-round and during migration. "The Ramble" inside Central Park is an area of particular repute among birders, because of its thick foliage and minimal human activity. Magnolia Warblers, Black-throated Blue Warblers, and Brown Thrashers are just a few of the bright colored spring arrivals in the dead center of New York's bustling metropolis.</p>

                <p>South of Playa del Rey, Dockweiler SB has become one of the known locales to search scoter rafts of winter ducks for unusual scoters. Surf Scoters are common in winter, but often a couple White-winged or Black Scoters may be tagging along with the group. These scoter rafts are usually a few hundred feet off shore, so a spotting scope is necessary to discern between species.</p>

                <p>Growing up in southern Connecticut came with its share of great spring migration birding. East Rock is one of the best birding spots in the state - the first week of May often holds more than 20 warbler species passing through, along with other colorful species like Rose-breasted Grosbeaks, Indigo Buntings, and Scarlet Tanagers. I saw my first Belted Kingfisher here on a 2nd grade field trip, and it was just one of many catalysts that brought me to the world of birding.</p>

                <h5>Washington County, OR, USA</h5>
                <p>About a 45 minute drive from downtown Portland, Fernhill Wetlands is a great cross-section of Oregon species. I've only birded it in winter months, while visiting family, but it's been fruitful for great views of Bald Eagle, Tundra Swan, Northern Shrike and many others.</p>

                <h5>Baltimore, MD, USA</h5>
                <p>In the northern sprawl of Baltimore's suburbs, my alma mater is a uniquely positioned piece of property - somewhat isolated, what we used to call the "Goucher Bubble." This effect contributed not only to the students experience, but wildlife's as well. Largely untouched swaths of woods surround the campus, and bore sightings like a Yellow-bellied Sapsucker and a Brown Creeper seen on my way to class, Common Nighthawks welcoming the dusk, and Purple Martins lazily soaring over.</p>

                <h5>Los Angeles, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>My first time birding at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, I happened upon a female Redhead - and no it wasn't Lucille Ball! Redhead the duck species - a single bird sitting in the pond. Not a common site in the middle of LA, but cemeteries can always hold surprises, being relatively isolated green areas in urban environments. I bird here every so often, sometimes catching a glimpse of the resident Indian Peafowl (the males of which are known as "peacocks").</p>

                <h5>San Bernardino County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>Just past the town of Mt. Baldy, on the border between L.A. and San Bernardino counties, Icehouse Canyon is a stunning hike up a rocky streambed. In winter it is often snowcovered, and though I haven't seen them myself, Bighorn Sheep have been reported at this location. The songs of Canyon Wrens grace your hike, and some alpine species can be seen like Hairy Woodpecker.</p>

                <h5>Joshua Tree, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>I find myself in Joshua Tree at least a few times a year - for desert hikes, barren beauty, the solace of isolation, and of course, the incredible desert birds. The visitor center's Oasis of Mara is a great place to start, with Phainopeplas abound, divebombing Costa's Hummingbirds, skulky Black-tailed Gnatcatchers and sometimes the errant Greater Roadrunner or Sage Thrasher. In early migration, I've consistently encountered Wilson's Warblers and Lincoln's Sparrows passing through this treasure trove.</p>

                <h5>Istria, Croatia</h5>
                <p>On my 30th birthday, I awoke in the nearby city of Pula, Croatia, ready to explore the peninsular coastal wonder that is Kamenjak. An idyllic, rocky cliffside beach and natural wildlife area, this was the perfect stop in early summer to sit along the sun-kissed rocks with my partner, a plate of fresh grilled squid and cold beer. As the locals playfully jumped in the water, I listened to bird songs alien to me - only my 2nd day in Croatia, still learning. But with a few recordings and some dedicated sleuthing, I came away with 14 species after a couple hours in paradise, including a migrating Subalpine Warbler, a pair of Melodious Warblers, and a Red-backed Shrike.</p>

                <h5>Los Angeles, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>A reminder of our geological and tectonic history, the La Brea Tar Pits sit in the middle of Central L.A., bubbling asphalt alongside bustling apartment complexes and Hollywood offices. The Museum at the Tar Pits is a fantastic visit as well, but the birds outside will keep you just as busy. The Museum is surrounded by park, and this being a green area in a relatively tight urban sector, interesting birds are bound to show up. I've had early season Pacific-slope Flycatchers, resident House Wrens, and even a pair of Common Yellowthroats trying to make do with the marshy habitat of the reeds along the edge of the actual tar pits!</p>

                <h5>Los Angeles, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>A stone's throw from DTLA, MacArthur Park is a sanctuary for trash, Canada Goose poop, and homeless encampments. But this city pond also consistently holds interesting ducks, gulls and geese. Upon arrival, I'm usually greeted by the family of Black-crowned Night-Herons who have adapted to perching on stoplights most of the day. Like other city parks in the past five years, the Egyptian Goose presence here has expanded somewhat: from one pair, to two, to almost 20 total birds now. Finding an interesting gull amongst the large flock is always a treat, but a task for the patient-minded and the unashamed - to be stared at in public that is - whether for your binoculars or spotting scope.</p>

                <p>I discovered this hotspot quite by accident in 2010. Roaming around the roads on the backside of the Loch Raven Reservoir, I wandered up an offshoot from Glen Arm Rd, parking my car and walking along the thick wooded road. I was suddenly greeted with the songs of multiple Wood Thrushes, and the surprise visage of a Lousiana Waterthrush appeared. After that, it became a must stop for me anytime I was driving in the area. Since then, 40 species have been reported from this fruitful road.</p>
